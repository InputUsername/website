In an attempt to use my blog more, I thought it would be fun to reflect on how I got into programming.

# The Beginning

It started around age nine, when I asked my dad how to make video games. He'd done some programming in the past, so we plopped down in front of the computer, installed [QBasic],
and got to work on a simple shooter game. Well, kind of - we didn't get very far, because my dad had never
made an interactive game before and I barely understood what was going on. Regardless, the damage was done and I knew I wanted to learn programming.
