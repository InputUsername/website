The current version of this website is a statically generated site using [Zola](https://getzola.org).
So far it's been great. However, none of the themes in Zola's theme gallery really fit my needs,
so I created my own: [Hook], which is the current theme.

[Hook]: https://github.com/InputUsername/zola-hook

Initially, I didn't want to support a dark mode, for various reasons: I thought it would require
JavaScript which I wasn't a fan of, and I also didn't want to complicate the styling too much.
After a late night proofreading session for [one of my posts](@/blog/gamemaker-sdks/index.md), though,
I changed my mind and decided to add a dark mode to Hook.

In this post, I'll go over some of the approaches I tried. If you just want to see the final result,

## A pure CSS approach

## Cleaning up the stylesheet

## Adding a manual toggle
