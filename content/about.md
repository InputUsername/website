Hi! My name is Koen and I'm a software engineer from The Netherlands.
I've obtained a bachelor's degree in Computing Science and a master's degree in Software Engineering
and Distributed Systems, both from the University of Groningen. This is my website/blog
where I occasionally write about (technical) stuff I've learned or that I find interesting.
Enjoy your stay!
