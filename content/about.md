Hi! My name is Koen and I'm a developer and Computing Science student from The Netherlands.
I've obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computing Science from the University of Groningen,
and I'm currently doing my Master's in Software Science at Radboud University.

I've been programming for a long time, and over the years I've created a whole bunch of projects.
Most of them are available on my [GitHub], but below is a selection of some of the more interesting ones.

## Projects

<div class="projects">

- [Nanotator] (2021):
    a scientific annotation tool for (extremely large) biomedical electron microscope images.
    It was created jointly with Daan Groot for our Bachelor's theses, and will be used by
    the [Giepmans lab] at the University of Groningen Medical Center (UMCG).
    The project was awarded an 8.5/10.
    Built using Angular, TypeScript, Express.js, Python, Flask, GDAL and Docker.
- [rescrobbled] (2019-now):
    a universal music "scrobbling" daemon for MPRIS-enabled music players. Rescrobbled listens
    for active music players and submits songs to services like Last.fm and ListenBrainz as they play.
    Built using Rust.
- [PyDash.io] (2018):
    a web service to help developers aggregate and visualize [Flask-MonitoringDashboard]
    deployments in one place. It was developed over a period of five months in a team of eight.
    I was the lead backend developer for the project.
    Built using Python, Flask, React and JavaScript.
- [Void Invaders] (2015-2017):
    a colorful and explosive arcade shoot-em-up game inspired by classics such as Galaga and
    Space Invaders. Made together with Noah Stolk under [VoidDev], it
    was published on Steam in 2015 by Black Shell Media (now Plug In Digital).
    Built using GameMaker: Studio and C++.
